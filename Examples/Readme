Two examples are provided with the exact set of parameters that you can see in both codes that are in this folder (Examples) for the Rabbit and the P.Falciparum. 
If you run the codes, you should get the same results as you can see in this folder with the name "Rabbit_Model_Results" for the Rabbit system, 
and "P.Falciparum_Model_Results" for the P.Falciparum. You can always play with parameters and variables to get different results.
